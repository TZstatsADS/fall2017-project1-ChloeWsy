### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title:  Data Story on US presidents' inaugural speeches
+ This project is conducted by [Siyi Wang]

+ Project summary: The United States has experienced three major economic crises in the twentieth century. During these important economic crises, three presidents were formally inaugurated. They were Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama. I choose these three presidents and the most controversial president in America history, Donald Trump, to study the similarities and differences between their inaugural speeches. Comparing the first inaugural addresses of these presidents may provide us important clues to their policies and attitudes which they have at different times.
